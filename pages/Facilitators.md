Leads research on applied statistics, biostatistics and infectious disease modelling at the individual and population level.  Prof Mwambi’s main areas of research areas are in applied statistics, biostatistics and infectious disease modelling at the individual and population level.  At the University of KwaZulu-Natal, he has taught theory and applied courses, among them a Biostatistics course covering key areas in biostatistics, namely general epidemiology principles, cohort studies, case-control studies, survival analysis and clinical trials.  He is currently working with and has supervised a number of PhD and Masters students on various topics in biostatistics and epidemiology such as the analysis of non-Gaussian longitudinal and clustered disease outcome data, survival analysis, modelling recurrent events, longitudinal data analysis including missing data, and infectious disease modelling.  Some of the students he has supervised hold senior positions as Biostatisticians and academics in leading medical and bioinformatics research institutes and centres and universities within South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and abroad.  He has authored and co-authored over 100 journal articles in reputable peer-reviewed international journals.  <br><br>He is keen and passionate to develop and help enhance biostatistics and data science capacity in the Sub-Saharan Africa region and Africa at large.  He is currently a Co-PI of a number of landmark projects among them the Sub-Saharan Africa Consortium for Advanced Biostatistics (SSACAB) Training Programme whose aim is to enhance capacity in Biostatistics through MSc, PhD and Postdoctoral training by involving both academic and research institutions to provide supervision and mentorship of fellows. </span> <a href="https://smscs.ukzn.ac.za/henry-mwambi/"><span style="text-align:center">Prof. Mwambi's website</span></a>

Currently, amongst many other projects, I am leading a project that implements novel measurements of wearables in vulnerable populations in Kenya and Burkina Faso to conduct cutting-edge climate change and health research, which helpd us gain new insights into the disease burden in poor populations facing exposure to climate change, such as heat or droughts. Furthermore, I lead the Blended Learning in Zambia (BLiZ) project that implements blended learning to strengthen medical education at the largest medical University in Zambia. In my research, I apply a variety of analytics models and cross-cutting analytics modeling concepts and cases.
